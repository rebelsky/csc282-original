CSC295 2014S, Class 02: Some Basic Tasks and Corresponding Tools
================================================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries.
    * Admin.
* Fun with GitHub.
* Go over homework.
* Exercise: The spaces problem.
* Raymond, chapter 1.
* Thinking about basic tools.

Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* I encourage you to attend CS table on Friday and talk about the ACM
  code of ethics.
* Status check 1: How many of you know the C bitwise operations?
  (`&`, `|`, etc.)
* Status check 2: Could anyone *not* make class if I moved it to 3:15pm?
  (Hands closed, blackball-style question.)
    * We are sticking with 1:15 p.m.
* Note: I was overly optimistic at the start of the semester.  Given the
  amount of time daily homework is taking in my three classes, I probably
  won't get a lot of chance to write the "book" for this class.  I will
  try to set up some lab problems, though.

### Questions

Fun with GitHub
---------------

* What happens when someone sends a pull request?
    * GitHub sends you a nice message with instructions.
    * You can browse the request to see how someone wants to screw up the
      repository.
* Isn't our site lovely?
    * Careful instructions and agreed-upon policies help

Go over homework
----------------

### That fun hypothetical C problem.  (Did anyone write code to cause 
the error?)

    int *x;     // Our array of data.
    int 
    main (int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      x = malloc (...);      
      foo ();
      bar ();
      free (x);   // Crash
    } // main

* Multithreaded program, foo or bar accesses x after it should.
    * foo and bar have terminated.
* malloc keeps track of how much space it has allocated
* Note: "You went beyond the null at the end of the array."
    * Arrays are not null terminated in C.
    * Strings *are* null terminated.

    char *str = malloc (sizeof (char) * 16);
    strcpy (str, "hello");
    printf ("%d\n", strlen (str));

### Spll chekcing

* Finding information, mechanism one: Google
* Check the manual pages `man -k spell` 
    * The -k is "keyword"
* So, our first solution is to use spell, but it gives us duplicates.
  What next?
    * Read the manual page
    * Use `uniq` - not quite

### URL extraction

Exercise: The spaces problem
----------------------------

Write it in C.   You have ten minutes.

Homework
--------

0. Learn Markdown so that we can use it for these assignments.

1. Learn about how you set and get environment variables.  Put your
explanations in the `submissions` directory, with a file named after
you.

    * Command line
    * Bash
    * C (get only)

2. Update our list of "things every *nix user should know" (either
in the repo

3. Come up with two or three tasks, similar to those we did for assignment
1, and put notes about them in the tasks directory.  (You can include
some sample solutions in your file.)

4. Read the first chapter of the Make book.
