CSC295 2014S, Class 04: Decoding Scripts
========================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries.
* Background.
* Analysis.
* Algorithm.
* Inputs.
* Implementation.

Preliminaries
-------------

* Apologies for not being able to be in class this week.  I had an
  unexpected obligation.  
* Colin will run class today.  Treat him well.
* I also won't be in class next week - I have to coach at the middle 
  school math competition.
* I'm likely to be sending out the homework in a day or two.

Background
----------

*Why did I give you this assignment?*

Analysis
--------

*What are things the user does in the shell that may cause strange things in the typescript?*

*What do you see in the file that corresponds to those actions?*

*How do you look at the contents of a file, anyway?*

*What should you do with the strange characters in the file?*

*You'll need a buffer in order to deal with backspace characters.  How big should it be?*

*What complications are we ignoring in this analysis?*

Algorithm
---------

*Given your analysis, what algorithm woud you write? (Pseudocode)*

Inputs
------

**Work in teams of 3/4**

*Create some typescripts that you expect to be hard to process.*

*Try one of the existing soln's.*

Implementation
--------------

**Work in teams of 3/4**

*Write your own solution, based on the algorithm you designed as a class.*
