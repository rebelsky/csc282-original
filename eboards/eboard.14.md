Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Grades entered.  You all pass.  No surprise.
* Don't forget Lexy's talk today at 4:30 p.m.

### Questions

The Subject Matter of the Course
--------------------------------

Background: Why I teach this course.

* When you use Unix and C well, you think differently
    * More concern for underlying representation
    * Particular models for problem solving
    * There are important tools for you as a C programmer
* Fitting more courses into the curriculum is hard

### Your turn: What have you learned?

Unix

* A way of thinking about programs: Small things, working together, 
  with streams of characters as the primary communications mode.
* Key Unix tools: xargs, grep, sed, 
* Ways to combine the tools.
* Make - Not too hard, make your work faster
    * If you're willing to put in the effort, you can make
      very complex, but very useful make files.
* Write good tools - Make you work faster
* Cron
* Unix jokes normally fail.
* Bash scripting
* Decoding man pages.

C

* Macros
* Tools for working with C
    * Valgrind
    * GDB
* Headers and thinking about C programs as multiple parts.
* Model of C ecosystems
    * Main application
    * Libraries for reuse
    * Command-line tools
    * Test!


General Programming

* Unit testing is good
* What makes it easiest for the programmer?  There are tools to
  help you.
* We should know Markdown.  

General

* Things exist
* I learned that I don't know a lot.
* It's hard to put a lot in a one-credit, one-hour, one-day-per-week 
  course, particularly when Sam has three conferences in a semester.
* Practice googling is good
* When you're bored, writing silly Unix scripts can be more fun than
  Minecraft.

Topics for future exploration
-----------------------------

What are other topics we might have covered?  What would you have
given up for those topics?

* More practice with GDB
* Lint
* GLib
* Fun with include files
* Obfuscated C competition
* Bitwise operations
* More practice everything

Course evaluation
-----------------

Conversation: Ordering of topics, additional topics, format, ...

* Add a second day in which we go over homework and Sam critiques it
    * Make it public: Blood and gore in CS day!
* More C, maybe?
* Add a quick refresher assignment - E.g., appendix 1 of K&R.
* More lab work in class - Practice in a guided setting.
    * With readings, like a normal lab-based class
* More Philosophy of Unix (e.g., from the Raymond text)
* Make the repo available earlier than four hours before HW is due.
  (More coding homework, better resources.)
* More curated resources (e.g., on GNU C style)
* Build something larger and meaningful (maybe across the semester)

Two most important of those

* Lab work plus readings [everyone]
* Second day [7]
* More coding homework with better infrastructure [4]
* Large project [4]
* Refresheher [2]
* More C [0]
* More Philosophy of Unix [0]
* Curated resources [0]

Can I offer this in alternate years, or should it be annual?

* Offer it, whether it's in alternate years or th same year.

Written: Standard EOCEs
