Frequently (and not-so-frequently) Asked Questions
==================================================

These are my attempts to answer some questions that students have asked
(in the first assignment, in office hours, via email, etc.)

Note that there may be some repetition on this page.

About the Site
--------------

The daily eboards look much nicer than what you type in class.  How
do I see what you type in class?

> _Replace the `.html` at the end with `.md`._

What technology do you use to build the course web?

> _I use two markup languages.  For many of the pages (e.g., readings,
> labs) I use a form of XML called Docbook.  But Docbook is wordy, so
> for other pages (e.g., the daily outlines and eboards), I use
> Markdown.  I also have a bunch of scripts to help with all of this.
> You can find the scripts and source code on GitHub._
