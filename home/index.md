Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Spring 2017 session of Grinnell College's CSC 282.01,
a one-credit course entitled *Thinking in C and Unix*.  In this course,
we will explore the approaches that professionals take when developing
software using C in the Unix/Linux environments.  But we will also
delve more deeply into the underlying ways of thinking that guides
this practice.

There will be very little lecture in the class.  The focus will be on
collaborative exploration of problems and their solutions.  Each class,
I expect to suggest a problem and an approach and to have the class discuss
and experiment with alternatives.

You can find all sorts of interesting things on the course web, and
I'd encourage you to look there.

Grading
-------

This course is offered for one credit and is graded as S/D/F.  College
guidelines dictate that one-credit courses rquire about three hours
per week.  All students who take the course are expected to

* attend at least twelve of the fourteen class meetings;
* do all of the assigned readings (about 30 minutes per week);
* spend an appropriate amount of time on each homework assignment (about
  90 minutes per week); and
* participate actively in class.

Students who meet these criteria will earn a grade of S.  Students who
do not will likely earn a lower grade.
