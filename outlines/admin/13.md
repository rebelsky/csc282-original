* Welcome to any trustees who are visiting today!
* Because next Thursday is the CS senior lunch, today is our last formal class.
    * I haven't received evaluation forms yet, so I'm not sure what we'll
      do about that.
* Snowden TED Talk CS Extra at 4:30 today.
* Snowden CS Table at noon tomorrow.
