* I encourage you to attend CS table on Friday and talk about the ACM
  code of ethics.
* Status check 1: How many of you know the C bitwise operations?
  (`&`, `|`, etc.)
* Status check 2: Could anyone *not* make class if I moved it to 3:15pm?
  (Hands closed, blackball-style question.)
* Note: I was overly optimistic at the start of the semester.  Given the
  amount of time daily homework is taking in my three classes, I probably
  won't get a lot of chance to write the "book" for this class.  I will
  try to set up some lab problems, though.
