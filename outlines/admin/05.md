* Apologies for not being able to be in class last week.
* Sorry for the confusion about last week and this.  I think things
  are now resolved.
* This week's assignment: Find an interesting use of macros and/or
  includes in C code in the wild and document it.
* Cool CS activities:
    * Thursday extra: Technical interviews.
    * CS Table Friday: Skip lists (if I ever find the paper).
