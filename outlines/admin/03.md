* I encourage you to attend CS table on Friday and talk about P vs. NP.
* Homework:
    * Part 1: Write a program that cleans up after `script`.  Put it
      in the repo.  (I'd recommend using C, but it's up to you.)
        * I'm sure you can find one.  You learn more by writing it.
    * Part 2: Write a bash script that finds all of the files under
      the current directory that end with .jpg and moves them to a
      directory called images.  Put it in the repo.
    * Part 3: Try to teach yourself `vi` or `vim` and add to the list of
      questions you'd like answered or tasks you'd like to learn how
      to solve.
    * Part 4: Learn enough Markdown that you can write useful answers.
