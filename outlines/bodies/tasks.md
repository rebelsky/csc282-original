Homework Discussion: Some simple tasks
======================================

*Discussion*

We'll go over the remaining tasks from the previous class.  Here are the
ones I note that we still have.

* Given a standard text file, remove all blank spaces at the end of lines.
* Make a list of all misspelled words in a text file.
* Given a CSV file in which each line has the form<br>
  `LastName,FirstName,Assignment,NumericGrade` <br>
  find the the five highest grades on homework 2.
* Given an HTML file, find the URLs of all images.  In case you don't
  know HTML, those will typically look like <br>
  `&lt;img src="*URL*"...&gt;`
  + The `img` can have any capitalization (`img`,
    `IMG`, `Img`,  `iMg`, etc.)
  + There can be other text between the `img` and the
    `src`.  (That text cannot include a greater than sign.)
  + You may find it easier to start this problem by assuming that there's only one image tag on a line.

Some important *nix tools
-------------------------

Now that we've looked at the problem, we've identified some useful programs.
Let's review the programs you found or know about.

I'll do my best to categorize them as you list them.

Looking ahead
-------------

We'll take a quick look at [the current version of the
schedule](../Handouts/schedule.html) so that you can see how I plan to
approach the course.

Some things that don't seem to be in the schedule, but could be if necessary.
* Regular expressions (likely to be part of next week's class)
* Command-line processing in C
* Process management in C (e.g., `fork`)
* Other scripting languages
* Playing with the mail server (forging mail is easy, this is more about 
  ways to write scripts that automate mail sending)
* vi (or vim)
