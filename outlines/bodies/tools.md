A Bit About Basic Tools
-----------------------

* As you may remember from the first day of class, I noted that to be
  successful in using *nix, you need to know a variety of tools (and know
  *of* a wider variety).
* There's no way we can do a full in-depth exploration of each important
  *nix tools.  So we'll look at common uses of a few important tools.
* My goal is to do two or three today and to deal with others as they
  come up.
